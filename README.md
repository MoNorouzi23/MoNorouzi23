### Hi there, I'm Mo Norouzi! 👋

#### About Me

I'm a **Marketing Data Scientist in the MedTech industry** with a strong passion for applying **data-driven approaches to business and marketing**. I’m fascinated by how data can uncover patterns, guide decisions, and create strategies that drive measurable growth.

I hold a graduate degree in **Business Administration and Marketing**, where I built expertise in market research and customer behavior. My journey later expanded into **data science**, combining business acumen with analytical and technical skills.  
I also completed a **Master of Data Science at UBC**, focusing on the intersection of data, marketing, and business decision-making.
